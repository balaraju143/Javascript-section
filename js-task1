
SECTION A: Technical Questions

1. Difference between var, let, and const

Feature | var | let | const
Scope | Function scope | Block scope | Block scope
Redeclaration | Allowed | Not allowed | Not allowed
Reinitialization | Allowed | Allowed | Not allowed

2. Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?
Answer: var
Reason: var is function-scoped, so redeclaring the same variable in the same scope is allowed.

3. Which keyword allows reinitialization?
Answer: var and let
Reason: Both allow assigning a new value after declaration.

4. Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
Answer: const
Reason: A const variable must be assigned once and cannot be changed or redeclared.

5. Why should const be used for fixed values?
Answer: Const prevents accidental reassignment, improves code safety, and makes the intent of
fixed values clear.

6. What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?
Answer: SyntaxError: Identifier has already been declared

7. What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?
Answer: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

8. Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?
Answer: let and const
Reason: They provide block scope, avoid bugs caused by var and improve code readability and
safety.

9. Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.
Answer: No.
Reason: const must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
Example:

const x; // Error


10. When should var be avoided?
Answer: var should be avoided in modern JavaScript because it is function-scoped and can cause
unexpected bugs due to hoisting and redeclaration.

11. Predict the output

var a = 10;
a = 20;
var a = 30;
console.log(a);
Output: 30
Reason: Var allows redeclaration and reinitialization.


12. Predict the output

let b = 5;
b = 15;
console.log(b);
Output: 15
Reason: let allows reinitialization but not redeclaration.


13. Identify the error
let x = 10;
let x = 20;
Error: SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared.
Reason: let does not allow redeclaration in the same scope.

14. Identify the error
const y = 50;
y = 100;
Error: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
Reason: const values cannot be reassigned.


15. Write a program using var to show redeclaration.
var a = 10;
var a = 20;
console.log(a);
Output: 20

16. Write a program using let to show reinitialization.
let count = 5;
count = 10;
console.log(count);
Output: 10

17. Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.
const PI = 3.14;
// PI = 3.1415; // Error
console.log(PI);
Explanation: const prevents changing values once assigned.


18. Convert var to let where applicable.
Before:
var marks = 60;
marks = 70;

After:
let marks = 60;
marks = 70;


19. Convert var to const where applicable.
Before:
var company = "Google";

After:
const company = "Google";


20. Write your own example for var, let, and const.

var fruit = "Apple";
var fruit = "Mango";
console.log(fruit);

let price = 100;
price = 150;
console.log(price);

const app = "React";
console.log(app);
